## Overview

In this workshop you will create a skill called Pet Match that matches the user 
with a pet. When launched, this Alexa Skill will prompt the user for the 
information it needs to determine a match. Once all of the required information
is collected, it will send the data to an external web service which processes
the data and returns the match.

Through this workshop, you'll learn how to use advanced Alexa Skills Kit 
features to create and configure an Alexa Skill and AWS Lambda. The advanced 
Alexa Skills Kit features you'll learn to use are Dialog Management and Entity
Resolution. These features leverage Alexa's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Machine Learning (ML), which makes
you life easier because you don't have to write code to leverage it. You only 
need to provide training to the Alexa engines via the Skill Builder.

## Pre-requistes

In order to start working on this lab guide you will need:

*  [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com)
*  [Amazon Developer Account](https://developer.amazon.com)


## Get Started

The workshop is composed of three parts:

*  Part 1: Build and Customize Pet match
*  Part 2: Entity Resolution
*  Part 3: Memory

Each part contains a set of tasks that act as check points, and extra credit
that will present a challenge that will further enhance your learning.

**Note** You may use Pet Match as a starting point to build your own skill that
needs to collect information form the suer and have processed via a web service.
You can customize the slots to match the data you need and change the hostname
to the web service you need to call.
